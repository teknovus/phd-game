## About

The Dream speedrun fork, gives obscene luck for positive events to allow you to get the PhD as early as possible

Technically a random event driven text-based game.

You can [play the original here](https://research.wmz.ninja/projects/phd/index.html) (using modern browsers or mobile devices).

Random events are defined in [YAML files](static/rulesets/default). Therefore, the game is easily moddable,

Currently the GUI code is purely vanilla, and kind of messy. I may clean it up if I have time.
